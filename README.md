## Repository Structure

- `CodeLabs/` - Directory containing Jupyter Notebooks with detailed explanations and code implementations.
- `LICENSE.md` - The Apache-2.0 License under which this project is distributed.

## Getting Started

To explore the materials:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlexeySharunov0/google-kaggle-genai-2025.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the CodeLabs Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd google-kaggle-genai-2025/CodeLabs
   ```

3. **Ensure Required Dependencies Are Installed**:
   Each Jupyter Notebook specifies all necessary libraries. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If `requirements.txt` is missing, install the libraries listed at the beginning of each notebook.

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser. If it does not open automatically, copy and paste the provided URL into your browser's address bar.

5. **Open a Notebook**:
   Navigate to the `CodeLabs` folder within Jupyter and select a notebook to explore and run.

## API Usage

Some notebooks utilize external APIs to demonstrate Generative AI capabilities. Instructions for obtaining the necessary API keys and setting up the environment are detailed within the respective notebooks. Please follow these instructions carefully for proper functionality.
